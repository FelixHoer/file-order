# file-order

file-order is a Java/Clojure desktop application, 
which allows the user to sort the contents of a folder via drag and drop.
To model this new succession for alphabetically ordered systems, 
the files are renamed (a prefix will be added).

This comes in handy when dealing with external devices, 
that depend on the alphabetical ordering of files, ie:

* TV that displays a slide show of pictures in your desired order
* Car radio that plays songs from a pendrive or CD

## Usage

Start the program by entering the following command in the `file-order` folder:

```
lein run
```
